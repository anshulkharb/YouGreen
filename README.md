Saving the Planet one video at a time

From cat videos to live game streaming, the world loves to watch videos on YouTube. YouTube has a variety of categories of videos, but music dominates them all, [almost all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos) the most-watched videos are music videos. It is a general process that we start playing our latest favorite on one tab and continue doing some other stuff on a different tab. But there's one problem in this, what? In the background tab, one song ends and another starts and it goes on, still couldn't figure out the problem? Problem is that videos are running continuously in the background and they're fetching 100s of MB on full HD quality.

Now let's jump into a different story. Some days ago, I came across [this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/does-irresponsible-web-development-contribute-to-global-warming/)

> According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy it takes 5.12 kWh of electricity per gigabyte of transferred data. And according to the Department of Energy the average US power plant expends 600 grams of carbon dioxide for every kWh generated. That means that transferring 1GB of data produces 3kg of CO2.

I cross-checked the data with different references, and surprisingly and unfortunately these numbers seem to accurate, possibly.

Now let's check some other numbers, [according to Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87)

> Watching TV shows or movies on Netflix uses about 1 GB of data per hour for each stream of standard definition video, and up to 3 GB per hour for each stream of HD video.

So if you'll watch or if you've watched the latest Stranger Things season in high definition, you are responsible for the emission of around 63kg of CO2!

For a rough idea, a car produces around 150-200gm of CO2 per km driven. Also, you can google the Carbon footprint of any daily activity.

Now, coming back to the problem.

We know that music videos are still running continuously in the background tab(since I start writing this article) while fetching 100s of MB on full HD quality, but what if there's a way in which we can still listen to the music in the same quality by restricting video quality to the lowest, which we were not watching anyway and it'll function by fetching just fraction of the data compared to former way.

So, here's the simple solution, YouGreen, saving the planet one video at a time

Here's it how it works:

Just install YouGreen. Now whenever any video that will autoplay in the background, it's video quality will automatically be downgraded to lowest. And when you'll come back to that tab, that was playing music in background, and play some other video manually, YouGreen will intelligently upgrade video quality.
