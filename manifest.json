But now you can listen to music on YouTube without wasting tons of GB data when music is playing in the background tab. This extension automatically downgrades video quality to lowest when music is playing in the background tab, without downgrading audio quality, and upgrades video quality intelligently when you visit YouTube tab to watch something.",
